# K-Fi-WP-13-Project
This project scans a document and returns all the relevant information in the document it needs onto a document called "Cheat Sheet".

To use, run the program. First, select the target file you wish to scan. I have provided a test document labeled "TEST ME".
Second, select the output folder you wish for "Cheat Sheet" to appear in. 
After these selections, the program will run and output the cheat sheet.
